# 📉 ARIMA Time Series Forecasting 📉

## Description
This project demonstrates time series forecasting using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models. The main objective is to visualize time series data, check stationarity with the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, decompose the series into trend, seasonal, and residual components, and build an ARIMA model to forecast future values.

## Features
- 📈 **Time Series Visualization**: Interactive plots for time series data.
- 🔍 **Stationarity Test**: ADF test to check if the data is stationary.
- 📉 **Decomposition**: Decomposes the series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
- 🔮 **ARIMA Forecasting**: Forecast future values using ARIMA models.
- 📂 **Custom Dataset Upload**: Upload your own dataset to forecast stock prices.

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Plotly`, `Statsmodels`, `Streamlit`
- **Model**: ARIMA for time series forecasting
- **Deployment**: Streamlit for interactive web-based interface

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
